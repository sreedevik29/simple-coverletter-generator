In my personal time, I greatly enjoy volunteering at the Toronto Distress Centres. As a crisis line worker, I provide frontline client-centred intervention to a variety of people experiencing distress or needing emotional support. Using empathy, communication, and active listening tools, I build rapport with the callers to provide appropriate interventions such as grounding practices, and suicide prevention techniques. This often requires me to employ problem solving skills by assessing their mental health status on the phone lines. I also write call reports to record and track changes of mental health status throughout the call. Overall, I learned to stay composed and communicate in a sensitive manner with people from vulnerable populations such as those living in poverty, people with disabilities, people identifying as LGBTQ+, people of colour, and other high-risk populations. I am a dedicated volunteer who enjoys working in an environment that helps me connect with clients on a more personal level.
