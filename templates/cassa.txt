I was also previously employed at a non-profit organization called Council of Agencies Serving South Asians (CASSA). During my time there, I successfully co-ordinated the 4th Annual Health Equity Summit by organizing sponsors, speakers, and a total of 100 attendees, which included health care providers, academics, policy makers, and community members. The goal of this Summit was to create the foundations of building an effective South Asian Health Strategy in Ontario. My leadership and communication skills were demonstrated by coordinating regular meetings with volunteers and various stakeholders.
