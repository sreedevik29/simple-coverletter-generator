As Child Life Volunteer at the Hospital for Sick Kids I was responsible for creating a positive play atmosphere to children awaiting their surgery. I was able to use my listening skills and empathy to communicate and understand their concerns to alleviate anxiety. My experience as a Student Mentor at All Saints Montessori School and East Scarborough Storefront, enhanced my organizational skills as I assisted in the planning of activities for children that promote their academic, creative, and athletic capabilities. In all these experiences, I was able to bring my enthusiasm and creativity to build trusted and long lasting relationships with children to teach and motivate them to perform their best efforts. It has shaped me to be a trusting, patient, and caring individual.
