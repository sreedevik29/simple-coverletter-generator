Under the supervision of the Knowledge Translation Department at CAMH, I had the opportunity to be involved with a research study on the dual use of alcohol and tobacco and the associated risk of cancer. I gained valuable skills learning how to conduct qualitative interviews with pregnant/post-partum women dealing with tobacco addiction, which I transcribed and coded. I also conducted telephone interviews for low-usage clients of the clinic, and recruited participants for engagement events, and updated all social media platforms pertaining to the PREGNETS website. Collaborating with diverse departments and programs helped me learn how to efficiently work in teams to execute these research protocols and maintain the core function of the team. My position at CAMH required me to manage multiple projects and I demonstrated strong organizational skills throughout the process.
