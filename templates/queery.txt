I currently work as a Research Assistant at the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work being involved in a study called Project QUEERY which focuses on media and technology use among queer and LGBTQ+ youth. I regularly conduct literature reviews on topics such as adverse childhood events and perceived stress among LGBTQ+ youth. One of my main responsibilities is also to code qualitative survey results and run analysis on the data, which enabled me to work together with colleagues to come to a consensus on the results. I greatly enjoy maintaining communication with the participants of the study as it helped me understand how a marginalized population such as LGBTQ+ youth, finds resilience and strength through their identification with media content.
