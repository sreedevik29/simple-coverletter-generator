I am applying for the position of work at place, as found on tere. I recently graduated with an Honours Bachelor of Science with specialist degree in Psychology. I am also a prospective graduate student of Social Work in the upcoming year at the University of Toronto as well. I think this is an exciting opportunity for me because bcuz.
I currently work as a Research Assistant at the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work being involved in a study called Project QUEERY which focuses on media and technology use among queer and LGBTQ+ youth. I regularly conduct literature reviews on topics such as adverse childhood events and perceived stress among LGBTQ+ youth. One of my main responsibilities is also to code qualitative survey results and run analysis on the data, which enabled me to work together with colleagues to come to a consensus on the results. I greatly enjoy maintaining communication with the participants of the study as it helped me understand how a marginalized population such as LGBTQ+ youth, finds resilience and strength through their identification with media content. 

Under the supervision of the Knowledge Translation Department at CAMH, I had the opportunity to be involved with a research study on the dual use of alcohol and tobacco and the associated risk of cancer. I gained valuable skills learning how to conduct qualitative interviews with pregnant/post-partum women dealing with tobacco addiction, which I transcribed and coded. I also conducted telephone interviews for low-usage clients of the clinic, and recruited participants for engagement events, and updated all social media platforms pertaining to the PREGNETS website. Collaborating with diverse departments and programs helped me learn how to efficiently work in teams to execute these research protocols and maintain the core function of the team. My position at CAMH required me to manage multiple projects and I demonstrated strong organizational skills throughout the process.
 
In my personal time, I greatly enjoy volunteering at the Toronto Distress Centres. As a crisis line worker, I provide frontline client-centred intervention to a variety of people experiencing distress or needing emotional support. Using empathy, communication, and active listening tools, I build rapport with the callers to provide appropriate interventions such as grounding practices, and suicide prevention techniques. This often requires me to employ problem solving skills by assessing their mental health status on the phone lines. I also write call reports to record and track changes of mental health status throughout the call. Overall, I learned to stay composed and communicate in a sensitive manner with people from vulnerable populations such as those living in poverty, people with disabilities, people identifying as LGBTQ+, people of colour, and other high-risk populations. I am a dedicated volunteer who enjoys working in an environment that helps me connect with clients on a more personal level.
 

Additionally, I possess excellent written skills through my experience of writing numerous essays and reports in varying sub-fields from psychology and mental health. They have strengthened my ability to think and communicate critically. My ability to manage my academics, my volunteering activities, and part-time job reflects my excellent organizational and time-management skills. I enjoy being involved in many extra-curricular activities as it provides opportunities to expand my research and clinical skills aside from theoretical academic knowledge.

Throughout my work and volunteer experience, I had the opportunity to work with people of all ages in varying fields from research to clinical experience. I am confident that the skills I have gained will make me a strong candidate as a work at the place. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Sincerely,
sre
